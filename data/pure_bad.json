He might tell her that as a foreigner and a woman, she\u2019s going to need protection from rapists and criminals, and he will protect her, because he\u2019s a man and a strong one, with a strong personality, which is part of being a man."

We were talking about kids things, when we happened to run into my mother. My mother, as you might already know, was a single mother who was raising her son by herself. The kid was the product of a one night stand with a man named Darren, but she was the only one who knew that. She and Darren had run off together. So I grew up with a mother who was a single mom. My mom wasn\u2019t just any single mom. She was on welfare, and she had a son that she took care of, and, to be honest, the only reason that she took care of the kid was because he was a constant reminder of Darren, the man that she had used her body to reproduce with. The kid was a constant reminder of her weakness and shame. I know this because she would sometimes talk to me about it. She would tell me stories"

The most accurate way to view this is to recognize that, in certain environments, all members of all groups underperform to some degree.
